"""Google's error envelope, per API family.

`google-api-python-client` reads ``error.message`` to build its ``HttpError``, and real clients
branch on ``error.status`` or ``errors[].reason``. FastAPI's default ``{"detail": …}`` gives them
none of that, so error handling could not be developed or tested against Backlot even though its
status codes were already right.

Everything here was measured against the live Docs / Drive / Gmail / Sheets / Slides APIs. The
envelope is NOT uniform — three families differ in which optional members they carry:

    family                  errors[]           status               no Authorization header, GET
    ------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------
    Drive v3                | always           | auth failures,      | 403 PERMISSION_DENIED
                            |                  | typed values,       |
                            |                  | `$.xgafv` and the   |
                            |                  | batch redirect only |
    Gmail v1                | unless $.xgafv=2 | always              | 401 UNAUTHENTICATED
    Docs v1 / Slides v1     | $.xgafv=1        | always              | 401 UNAUTHENTICATED
    Sheets v4               | $.xgafv=1        | always              | 403 PERMISSION_DENIED

Sheets parts from the other two editor APIs on that last column: measured, a GET with no
Authorization header is 403 PERMISSION_DENIED with the unregistered-caller sentence, where Docs
answers 401 UNAUTHENTICATED with the missing-credential one. The column is the GET rule only
(:func:`no_credentials`). A present-but-invalid token is 401 UNAUTHENTICATED in every family, which
is why a missing header and a bad token are separate constructors here rather than one
"unauthorized".

`errors[]` is what `$.xgafv` selects, and the middle column above is the whole rule
(:func:`has_errors_array`). It is a SYSTEM parameter — a top-level entry of a discovery document's
``parameters``, which every method takes — so it is validated once for the router
(:func:`validate_system_parameters`) and declared once for the document
(:func:`backlot.openapi.google_system_parameters`) rather than route by route. Measured: Drive
carries the array on a `fields` refusal at `2` as well as with no parameter; the LAST repeat is the
value every rule about THIS parameter reads (`2&1` carries it on Sheets where `1&2` does not, `2&0`
on Gmail — a refused value is not a `2` — where `0&2` does not), which is the opposite of the other
system parameters (:func:`first_repeat`); a success body is the same under all of them; and a value
other than `1` or `2` is refused ahead of a bad token, a missing credential and an unparseable range
alike.

`callback` is the second system parameter :func:`validate_system_parameters` checks, and the one
that decides how a body reaches the wire rather than what is in it: see :func:`respond`, which is
also where the indentation and the charset every Google error carries are decided.

Inside `errors[]` the entry follows the constructor that raised it, and each one carries its own
measurement. Measured on Sheets and Docs at `$.xgafv=1`: a typed value the proto layer refuses is
``reason: invalid`` with NO ``domain`` (:func:`invalid_field_value`), and so are a JSON body member
the request message does not have and a JSON body that is not an object
(:func:`invalid_field_values`); a request body that is not JSON is ``parseError``
(:func:`invalid_json`); every other measured 400 is ``badRequest`` under ``global``
(:func:`invalid_argument`, :func:`bad_field_mask`); a 404 is ``notFound``; a bad token ``authError``
at ``location: Authorization``; an anonymous Sheets GET ``forbidden``; the missing credential — any
anonymous POST, and a GET on the three OAuth-only APIs — ``required`` with the short
``Login Required.``; and the 500 the data-filter reads answer ``backendError``
(:func:`internal_error`). The editor 400 NOT measured keeps whatever its constructor renders: an
Office file read as a native document is :func:`failed_precondition`, so ``failedPrecondition``.

    `values:batchGetByDataFilter` and on `spreadsheets:getByDataFilter` is ignored outright -- no
    wrap on a success, none on an error, and a name that a GET would be refused for is not even
    looked at -- where the same POST honours `$.xgafv` and `prettyPrint`. So GET is the only
    method this parameter applies to.

    Two values that look like a callback are not one either. An empty `callback=` is absent:
    measured, it answers the plain body at the real status, success and error alike. So is any
    `alt` NAMING A FORMAT other than `json` -- which spellings do name that format is
    :func:`alt_format`'s half, and `JSON` and an empty `alt=` are among them. Measured on Sheets,
    `alt=media`, `alt=proto` and `alt=zzz` each answer their own 400 unwrapped, even when

    A Drive byte-stream read is out of the JSONP path for a third reason, and one this function is
    not asked to decide: a `callback` on a download is neither refused nor wrapped by the JSONP
    path but is real's 503 on any failure (:func:`refuse_download`). Which requests those are is
    ``routers.google._drive_download``'s question, read off the route, and the dependency that
    would call this for one passes ``callback=False`` instead.

    Which `alt` counts as JSON is :func:`alt_format`'s question, not this one's -- `alt=JSON` and
    `alt=` are the JSON the default spells, and answering them unwrapped is the divergence that
    reading the value literally here used to produce.

    the newlines an indented body is laid out with are the same character.

    It reaches the plain body as much as the wrapped one and a success as much as an error:
    measured, a Sheets cell holding ``<b>&'x`` comes back with the brackets escaped and `&`, `'`

    reads it.

    Wrapped only where ``validate_system_parameters`` checked `callback`, which is where a route
    matched and did not exempt it. That is a ROUTER dependency, so a family path with NO route --
