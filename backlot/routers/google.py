# --- `q` ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Drive's query language, parsed as the reference's grammar and evaluated term by term, so a clause
# is either evaluated or refused — never dropped from the filter while the listing answers 200.
# mirage sends two of its shapes: its folder listing resolves a file with `name='…'` and bounds a
# sync with `modifiedTime >= '…'` and `modifiedTime < '…'`.
#
# The grammar is the reference's (developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/ref-search-terms):
# a term is `<field> <operator> <value>` or `'<value>' in <collection>`, terms join with `and` and
# `or`, `not` negates, and a string value is single-quoted with an apostrophe escaped as `\'` —
# "Escape single quotes in queries with \'". Parentheses group. Whether `and` binds before `or` the
# reference does not say; Backlot reads it as SQL does, `and` first.
#
# A term Backlot cannot evaluate is a 400 on `q`, never a silence. Two kinds: a term the reference
# does not list (`bogusField = 'x'`), which real Drive refuses too — its wording is unmeasured, so
# the bare `Invalid Value` of the parameter envelope stands — and a documented term Backlot holds no
# fact for, refused with a message that says so, the way an unmodelled `orderBy` key is. Honouring
# `starred = true` as "everything" would be the listing this section exists to stop.

# Every term Backlot evaluates, with the operators the reference lists for it.

# endpoints serve the corpus content shaped into each API's read response, keyed on the same
# Drive file id, and enforce the same ACL as Drive.

#
# * `R` and `C` each take an ABSOLUTE 1-based number (`R1C1`), a BRACKETED 0-based offset from A1
#   (`R[1]C[1]` is B2, `R[0]C[0]` is A1 — the concepts guide's "relative to the current cell" has
#   A1 as the current cell on a read), or no number at all (`R1C` is A1, `RC` is A1). Absolute 0
#   and a negative or `+`-signed offset are unparseable; a leading zero is fine (`R01C01` is A1).
# * either letter may be absent. Beside an R1C1 half a numbered `R2` is row 2 with the columns
#   unbounded (`R1C1:R2` is A1:Z2) and `C[1]` alone is column B whole (`B1:B1000`); a bare `R`, `C`
#   or `RC` is the cell A1.
# * both halves of a range are read in ONE notation: `A1:R2C2` and `R1C1:B2` are unparseable. A
#   token is read as A1 first (`R1` is the cell R1, `RC1` the cell RC1, `RC:RC` the columns RC),
#   then as R1C1 (`RC` alone is A1, and so is `R1C1` even in a workbook with a sheet named `R1C1`),
#   then — bang-less — as a sheet name (`A` is the sheet `A` when there is one).
# * a reversed R1C1 range is swapped the way an A1 one is (`R3C3:R1C1` is A1:C3), except that on
#   an axis where both halves carry a number OF THE SAME KIND — both absolute, or both offsets —
#   start == end + 1 on the numbers AS WRITTEN is unparseable: `R2C2:R1C1`, `R1C2:R1C1`,
#   `R[1]C[1]:R[0]C[0]` and `R2:R1C1` 400 while `R3C3:R1C1` and `R[2]C[2]:R[0]C[0]` answer. An
#   axis that mixes the kinds swaps freely: `R[1]C[1]:R1C1`, `R[2]C[2]:R1C1` and `R1C1:R[0]C[0]`
#   all answer. That reads as a half-open interval on the raw numbers coming out empty, checked
#   before offsets are resolved; every reversed range sent is a row of `MEASURED_R1C1`.
# * the echo is the A1 equivalent, and the grid rules are A1's: an end past the grid is clamped
#   (`R1C1:R2000C50` is A1:Z1000, `1:1001` is A1:Z1000), a start past it is refused (`R[1000]C[0]`
#   names `A1001`), and a refused whole column or row is named by its letters or numbers alone,
#   one column or row collapsing as one cell does (`ZZ:ZZ` names `ZZ`, `AA:AB` names `AA:AB`,
#   `C[26]` names `AA`, `R[1000]:R[1000]` names `1001`, `1001:1002` names `1001:1002`).
# * whitespace is refused wherever it was tried — around the whole, around the bang, around the
#   colon, inside a token, inside a quoted title, a tab as much as a space: ` A1`, `Sheet1! A1`,
#   `A1: B2`, `R1 C1`, `R[ 1]C[1]`, `'Sheet1 '!A1` — all 36 forms sent — are unparseable. An EMPTY title

    Real parses every repeat of a typed parameter, not only the one it reads, and refuses all it
    cannot parse in one 400 (:func:`gerr.invalid_field_values`). :func:`gerr.first_repeat` names
    the parameters a bad value at either end was measured on, and the end each is READ from, which
    is the caller's to pick.

    The refusals are grouped by parameter, each parameter's in query order, and the groups come in
    the order their parameters first appear. Measured 2026-09-23, eight identical requests each:
    `majorDimension=NOPE1&valueRenderOption=NOPE2&majorDimension=NOPE3` kept the two
    `major_dimension` refusals together and in that order every time, while which parameter came
    first varied from one request to the next (`valueRenderOption=NOPE&majorDimension=NOPE`
    answered each order four times), so first appearance is one of the orders real gives.

    Its callers run it after the credential and before the lookup, measured 2026-09-30 on Drive
    `files.get` and `permissions.list` and on Sheets `values.get`, `values:batchGet` and
    `spreadsheets.get`: with no credential or a bad one, a bad value is answered with the
    credential's refusal, and with a good one it is this 400 for an id that does not exist, where
    the same request without the bad value is the 404. `permissions.list` checks its `pageSize`
    range at the same point, as real does: `pageSize=0` on a missing file is the range refusal."""
