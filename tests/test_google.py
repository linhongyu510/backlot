# Every range-related request sent to the live Sheets API on 2026-09-12 (#174), on a workbook whose
# sheets were `Sheet1`, `Data`, `R1C1`, `RC` and `A` (1000x26 each, `a`..`f` in A1:B3 of the first
# two), with what came back: the status and the echoed `range`, or the error message — both
# notations, whitespace around the bang and inside a token, whole rows and columns past the grid,
# an empty title before the bang. The test below serves a corpus with the same five sheets and
# holds Backlot to every row, so the grammar in `_R1C1_END`'s comment is what this table says and
# not what a document says.
